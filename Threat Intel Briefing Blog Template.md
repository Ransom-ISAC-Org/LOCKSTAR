## 📈 Probability Matrix (Reference)

> This matrix is adapted from NATO's risk assessment methodologies, which combine the probability of an event occurring with its potential impact to determine overall risk levels.

| Probability       | Impact       | Risk Level |
|------------------|-------------|------------|
| Almost Certain    | Catastrophic| Extreme    |
| Likely            | Major       | High       |
| Possible          | Moderate    | Medium     |
| Unlikely          | Minor       | Low        |
| Very Unlikely     | Negligible  | Very Low   |
