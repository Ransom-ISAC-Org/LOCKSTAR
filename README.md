# About LOCKSTAR
Repository for the LOCK STAR initiative. This includes guidance and any supporting files for writeups. 

We are **Ransom-ISAC**, the dedicated ISAC for ransomware intelligence. Our mission is to break down barriers between organizations and reduce ransomware dwell time through smarter, faster knowledge sharing.

We aim to stamp out ransomware by providing **affordable, high-quality threat intelligence** to everyone. We empower security professionals‚Äîboth full-time and freelance‚Äîby offering recognition, opportunity, and access, removing gatekeeping, and fostering a united fight against ransomware.

And if we succeed‚Ä¶ well, we won‚Äôt be needed anymore. Simple as that.

Behind the scenes, we‚Äôre working on exciting initiatives. 

**The problem:** 

As an independent body, we want to create **a standardized way for ransomware pioneers and researchers to gain the recognition they deserve**‚Äîwithout their efforts going unnoticed.

Imagine a system like the **Michelin stars** of the cybersecurity world (picture a subtle twinkling chef‚Äôs hat or glowing star).

Introducing **Ransom-ISAC‚Äôs L.O.C.K. S.T.A.R.:**

This framework allows individuals‚Äîand their organizations‚Äîto gain formal recognition as some of the world‚Äôs leading subject-matter experts.

Want to get involved? It‚Äôs simple. We‚Äôre expanding our blogging program‚Äîbut these won‚Äôt be typical blogs. We want you to **teach a novel workflow**, bridging the gap between actionable knowledge sharing and partially shared intelligence.

A **L.O.C.K. S.T.A.R.** can be earned in any of these domains:

- Infrastructure
- Negotiations
- HUMINT
- Cryptocurrency
- DFIR
- Reverse Engineering
- AI
- Quantum

# LOCKSTAR Guidelines
# LOCK STAR Rules and Guidelines

The **LOCK STAR** framework recognises contributors who set themselves apart through high-quality, responsible, and educational content. Unlike traditional conference talks or blog posts, LOCK STAR contributions are expected to be **detailed to the point of being training material** ‚Äî guiding others through the process, not just showcasing outcomes.

---

## üß≠ Candidate Responsibility & Representation

- **Self-driven contributions**: LOCK STAR candidates are responsible for proposing, developing, and delivering their own content. Candidates represent themselves and their professional brand through their submissions.
- **Content co-ownership**: While the **full article and training material (including step-by-step write-ups)** will be hosted on **Ransom-ISAC**, ownership of the work is shared between **Ransom-ISAC and the LOCK STAR candidate**.
- **Independence of representation**: Recognition as a LOCK STAR does not imply endorsement or liability by Ransom-ISAC. **Ransom-ISAC is not responsible for any illicit or unethical activities** conducted by contributors. This is also prohibited and not endorsed by Ransom-ISAC.
- **Employer alignment**: Candidates must ensure their contributions comply with their employer‚Äôs policies and obtain necessary permissions to represent themselves in this capacity.

## ‚úÖ Acceptable Contributions

- **Blogging and Publications**: In-depth technical write-ups designed to educate, not just inform.
- **Community Engagement**: Active contribution to the **infosec community via Ransom-ISAC**.
- **Conferences and Presentations**: Workshops, talks, or sessions that go beyond surface-level insights and provide structured learning.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Rules of Conduct

- **Political neutrality**: Contributions must remain free from political bias or commentary.
- **No active investigations**: Do not publish details of ongoing incidents or investigations.
- **Lawful practice only**: Avoid unlawful activity, including active scanning, exploitation, or unauthorised intrusions.
- **No illicit methods**: Findings must be obtained through legitimate, ethical means.
- **Respectful communication**: Avoid offensive, discriminatory, or harmful language in any contribution.
- **Unbiased content**: Present research and findings objectively, without sensationalism or favouritism.
- **Community-first approach**: All contributions should aim to educate, inform, or improve collective resilience.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Standards for LOCK STAR Content

- **Detailed explanations**: Write-ups and presentations must be comprehensive enough that a reader or attendee could follow step by step and attempt the process themselves.
- **Originality required**: Content should offer a unique perspective, methodology, or finding ‚Äî not simply repeat what already exists.
- **Content engineering**: Treat each piece as if it were **cyber security training material**, with clarity, reproducibility, and clear guidance on how findings were reached.
- **Applied learning**: Contributions should empower others with practical takeaways that they can use in their own work.

---

## üåç Recognition

- Recognition as a **LOCK STAR** is awarded on the basis of **quality, originality, depth, and educational value**.
- Both **individual and collaborative efforts** are eligible, provided they align with these guidelines.
