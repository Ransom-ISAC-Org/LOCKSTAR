## 🔐 About Us
We are **Ransom-ISAC**, the dedicated ISAC for ransomware intelligence.  
Our mission is simple: **break down barriers** between organizations and **reduce ransomware dwell time** through smarter, faster knowledge sharing.  

💡 We aim to **stamp out ransomware** by providing affordable, high-quality threat intelligence to everyone.  
We empower security professionals — full-time and freelance — by:  
- 🚪 Removing gatekeeping  
- 🏅 Offering recognition and opportunity  
- 🌍 Fostering a united fight against ransomware  

> And if we succeed… we won’t be needed anymore. **Simple as that.**

## 🚀 What We’re Working On
Behind the scenes, we’re building exciting initiatives to strengthen the ransomware research community.  

### ⚡ The Problem
Independent researchers and pioneers often don’t receive the recognition they deserve.  
We need a **standardized system** to highlight their impact — much like the **Michelin stars** of the cybersecurity world.  
(✨ Imagine a glowing ⭐ next to a researcher’s name, or a subtle 👨‍🍳 hat symbolizing mastery.)

# LOCK STAR Rules and Guidelines

The **LOCK STAR** framework recognises contributors who set themselves apart through high-quality, responsible, and educational content. Unlike traditional conference talks or blog posts, LOCK STAR contributions are expected to be **detailed to the point of being training material** — guiding others through the process, not just showcasing outcomes.

---

## 🧭 Candidate Responsibility & Representation

- **Self-driven contributions**: LOCK STAR candidates are responsible for proposing, developing, and delivering their own content. Candidates represent themselves and their professional brand through their submissions.
- **Content co-ownership**: While the **full article and training material (including step-by-step write-ups)** will be hosted on **Ransom-ISAC**, ownership of the work is shared between **Ransom-ISAC and the LOCK STAR candidate**.
- **Independence of representation**: Recognition as a LOCK STAR does not imply endorsement or liability by Ransom-ISAC. **Ransom-ISAC is not responsible for any illicit or unethical activities** conducted by contributors. This is also prohibited and not endorsed by Ransom-ISAC.
- **Employer alignment**: Candidates must ensure their contributions comply with their employer’s policies and obtain necessary permissions to represent themselves in this capacity.

## ✅ Acceptable Contributions

- **Blogging and Publications**: In-depth technical write-ups designed to educate, not just inform.
- **Community Engagement**: Active contribution to the **infosec community via Ransom-ISAC**.
- **Conferences and Presentations**: Workshops, talks, or sessions that go beyond surface-level insights and provide structured learning.

---

## ⚖️ Rules of Conduct

- **Political neutrality**: Contributions must remain free from political bias or commentary.
- **No active investigations**: Do not publish details of ongoing incidents or investigations.
- **Lawful practice only**: Avoid unlawful activity, including active scanning, exploitation, or unauthorised intrusions.
- **No illicit methods**: Findings must be obtained through legitimate, ethical means.
- **Respectful communication**: Avoid offensive, discriminatory, or harmful language in any contribution.
- **Unbiased content**: Present research and findings objectively, without sensationalism or favouritism.
- **Community-first approach**: All contributions should aim to educate, inform, or improve collective resilience.

---

## 🛠️ Standards for LOCK STAR Content

- **Detailed explanations**: Write-ups and presentations must be comprehensive enough that a reader or attendee could follow step by step and attempt the process themselves.
- **Originality required**: Content should offer a unique perspective, methodology, or finding — not simply repeat what already exists.
- **Content engineering**: Treat each piece as if it were **cyber security training material**, with clarity, reproducibility, and clear guidance on how findings were reached.
- **Applied learning**: Contributions should empower others with practical takeaways that they can use in their own work.

---

## 🌍 Recognition

- Recognition as a **LOCK STAR** is awarded on the basis of **quality, originality, depth, and educational value**.
- Both **individual and collaborative efforts** are eligible, provided they align with these guidelines.
